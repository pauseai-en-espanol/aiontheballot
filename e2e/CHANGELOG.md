# @aiontheballot/e2e

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- bc2fe41: A country admin may announce a draft election (migration `announced_elections`), so a tenant's coming-soon page names
  it and gives its date before it goes live. The public sees the announced election's own row and nothing under it.
  ADR-0002's public-visibility rule is amended accordingly (PLAN R51).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7f83fd8: Site icons: the platform's default (the coming-soon ballot, marked with the AI sparkle, on an orange tile), or a
  tenant's own square PNG from its new `site_icon` logo slot (a whole PNG, 512 to 1,024 px). Pages name the icons by
  content hash at `/brand/icon/{size}.{hash}.png`, cached as immutable, with `/favicon.ico` and a web manifest. The
  seeds give `ejemplo-a` a fictional icon.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a2cea6d: File bytes move from Postgres to a persistent volume (migration `files_on_volume`, ADR-0004): the API mounts a
  `local-path` volume of type `local` at `/data` and reads each file's bytes from its row's own tenant and bucket, only
  for a row RLS shows, checking the hash on every read. `file_blobs` and the brand assets' inline bytes are gone; the
  migration refuses to run while any bytes are stored in the database. `node dist/put-file.js <tenant-id> <bucket>`
  puts bytes on the volume from stdin until the admin can upload them, and `node dist/purge-tenant-files.js` deletes a
  purged tenant's folder, given proof of the purge. Web and admin are rebuilt only because turbo.json changed.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f4eabe: Tenants' own logos (migration `tenant_brand_uploads`): a brand selection can name one of the tenant's uploaded
  images, public while an active tenant selects it. The API serves the home data's brand images by hash; the web app
  shows the operator's logo in the coming-soon page's header and footer, at `/brand/{sha256}.{ext}` cached as immutable,
  and draws it on the share cards.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bcb112: Link previews for the coming-soon page: Open Graph and Twitter tags, the canonical address and `hreflang` from the
  routing table, and share images in the four sizes from the new `packages/og` (satori, then resvg, fonts embedded),
  served from content-hash URLs cached as immutable, with 304s. Images are pre-rendered while their page renders and
  when a server starts. The hero's name is sized by the viewport's height too.

### Patch Changes

- 0504b2c: The share tests fetch by Host header on 127.0.0.1, so they pass on Linux runners, which can't resolve `*.localhost`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f43760: A tenant's home is now its coming-soon page, in PauseAI's brand: the tenant's name, what the site will do, the next
  public election and the operator's links, all from data, in Spanish and English, on a desktop and a phone. The API
  serves it at `GET /public/tenants/{slug}/home` (read as `aiontheballot_web`); the web app caches each tenant's copy
  and keeps it when the API fails. The shared preset gains the brand colours as semantic tokens, contrast-tested, and
  the self-hosted fonts. The e2e suite checks the page with axe at both sizes.
- d167b29: The coming-soon page offers the operator's newsletter ("Avísame cuando se publique"), from the new
  `organizations.newsletter_url` (migration `organization_newsletter`); the platform collects no addresses. The ballot is
  now an SVG that scales down to a phone, and the tenant's name is sized by its longest word, which never breaks.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 685914f: Route the public site by host: the web app's `proxy.ts` runs `resolve()` with routing data from the API's new
  `GET /public/routing` (read as `aiontheballot_web`), rewriting tenant pages to their internal path, redirecting aliases
  and platform paths, and answering 404 to everything else. The e2e stack runs on a migrated, seeded database and tests
  status codes, `Location`, a spoofed `X-Forwarded-Host`, the internal prefix and the absence of cookies.

### Patch Changes

- 7d03e3f: Send the web relay's request checks to the server's address: Node can't resolve `.localhost` names on the CI runner.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 9504ee9: Report errors to GlitchTip (ADR-0003 §7). The API and the Next servers send to its in-cluster Service when
  SENTRY_DSN is set. Browsers send through /_relay/errors on the app's own host, which forwards only to that app's
  project with the DSN held server-side. The public site loads its browser SDK only on the first error. No personal data
  leaves the apps: data collection is off and every event is scrubbed (no user, no query strings, emails redacted). The
  i18n catalogue can be imported without the message formatter, and both apps get a root error page.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c217473: Add Playwright smoke tests against production builds of web, admin and api: pages render, health probes answer, and
  the public site sets no cookies and keeps zoom enabled. Read the platform name at request time: the layouts were
  prerendered at build time, so every image would have shipped without a title.
