## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 41136b9: Dependencies bump

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- 5e3e7a7: From the security audit (PLAN R208). The API answers a fault as `unexpected`, never with its message, reports it
  once, by its code, and answers an unknown route under `/api` with its own headers. The error relays refuse what a
  browser marks as sent from any other origin, and the admin's chart can limit its relay per address, as the web chart
  does. The share images take fflate 0.7.5, which fixes an advisory in code they never call. The migrations image is
  unchanged, rebuilt only because the shared lockfile changed.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- e1010f7: Comments, chart notes and examples describe what the platform needs from its host, never the host itself (PLAN
  R205): the deployment's specifics stay in the operator's private configuration. No behaviour changes.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 1ffae74: Dependencies bmp

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- a8ed7d2: Dependencies bump

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 7ba5873: Dependencies bump

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 47da044: The first account (PLAN R93): `node dist/create-account.js`, run in an API pod, asks for an email and a name, creates
  a verified account and prints a single-use, one-hour link to the admin's new set-password page (its token in the
  fragment, kept hashed), plus the SQL that makes it a platform admin once its person has enrolled TOTP. The API accepts
  that token at /api/auth/reset-password, and setting a password ends the account's sessions. Error reports also drop
  the query and fragment of URL-like context fields and tags.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 94c11b3: The public site loads each tenant's Plausible script from its own host and relays the script's events
  (`/_relay/views.js`, `/_relay/views`; PLAN R83): every Plausible feature, no request to another host, no cookie. It
  counts nothing until the deployment sets `PLAUSIBLE_URL` and `PLAUSIBLE_SITES`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9504ee9: Report errors to GlitchTip (ADR-0003 §7). The API and the Next servers send to its in-cluster Service when
  SENTRY_DSN is set. Browsers send through /_relay/errors on the app's own host, which forwards only to that app's
  project with the DSN held server-side. The public site loads its browser SDK only on the first error. No personal data
  leaves the apps: data collection is off and every event is scrubbed (no user, no query strings, emails redacted). The
  i18n catalogue can be imported without the message formatter, and both apps get a root error page.
