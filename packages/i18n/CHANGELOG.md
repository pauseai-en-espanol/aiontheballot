# @aiontheballot/i18n

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a30cfe: Link previews get their own shorter description (under 125 characters, which phones show), and search keeps the full
  sentence.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f4eabe: Tenants' own logos (migration `tenant_brand_uploads`): a brand selection can name one of the tenant's uploaded
  images, public while an active tenant selects it. The API serves the home data's brand images by hash; the web app
  shows the operator's logo in the coming-soon page's header and footer, at `/brand/{sha256}.{ext}` cached as immutable,
  and draws it on the share cards.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f43760: A tenant's home is now its coming-soon page, in PauseAI's brand: the tenant's name, what the site will do, the next
  public election and the operator's links, all from data, in Spanish and English, on a desktop and a phone. The API
  serves it at `GET /public/tenants/{slug}/home` (read as `aiontheballot_web`); the web app caches each tenant's copy
  and keeps it when the API fails. The shared preset gains the brand colours as semantic tokens, contrast-tested, and
  the self-hosted fonts. The e2e suite checks the page with axe at both sizes.
- d167b29: The coming-soon page offers the operator's newsletter ("Avísame cuando se publique"), from the new
  `organizations.newsletter_url` (migration `organization_newsletter`); the platform collects no addresses. The ballot is
  now an SVG that scales down to a phone, and the tenant's name is sized by its longest word, which never breaks.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 9504ee9: Report errors to GlitchTip (ADR-0003 §7). The API and the Next servers send to its in-cluster Service when
  SENTRY_DSN is set. Browsers send through /_relay/errors on the app's own host, which forwards only to that app's
  project with the DSN held server-side. The public site loads its browser SDK only on the first error. No personal data
  leaves the apps: data collection is off and every event is scrubbed (no user, no query strings, emails redacted). The
  i18n catalogue can be imported without the message formatter, and both apps get a root error page.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e85ec0: Add the shared domain package (methodology kinds and their rating scales) and the i18n package (English source
  messages, mandatory Spanish checked against them, and a typed translator usable outside Next).
- 85ada24: Add the shared Panda preset (@aiontheballot/ui) and the public and admin Next.js skeletons: a translated placeholder page,
  an unlogged /healthz, zoom left enabled, and no cookies or X-Powered-By on the public app. Add the "coming soon"
  message. Build packages without composite/incremental output so a JSON-only change can never leave stale
  declarations.

### Patch Changes

- e13c986: Move to @slango.configs/typescript 3.0.0 and @slango.configs/vitest 2.1.0: drop the composite/incremental overrides
  and the i18n JSON include they required, and write the Vitest configs in TypeScript.
