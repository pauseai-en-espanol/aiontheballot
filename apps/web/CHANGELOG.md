# @aiontheballot/web

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 7a6d8c4: Run on Node 26.11.1: the base images (pinned by digest) and the engines range.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9504ee9: Report errors to GlitchTip (ADR-0003 §7). The API and the Next servers send to its in-cluster Service when
  SENTRY_DSN is set. Browsers send through /_relay/errors on the app's own host, which forwards only to that app's
  project with the DSN held server-side. The public site loads its browser SDK only on the first error. No personal data
  leaves the apps: data collection is off and every event is scrubbed (no user, no query strings, emails redacted). The
  i18n catalogue can be imported without the message formatter, and both apps get a root error page.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9504ee9]
  - @aiontheballot/observability@0.2.0
  - @aiontheballot/i18n@0.1.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ed9131: Ship Docker images: web, admin and api built with turbo prune (manifest-only install layer), running as non-root, and
  a migrations image (dbmate plus the migrations) for the chart's PreSync Job. The Next apps run panda codegen as part of
  their build, so builds no longer depend on install-time hooks.
- 85ada24: Add the shared Panda preset (@aiontheballot/ui) and the public and admin Next.js skeletons: a translated placeholder page,
  an unlogged /healthz, zoom left enabled, and no cookies or X-Powered-By on the public app. Add the "coming soon"
  message. Build packages without composite/incremental output so a JSON-only change can never leave stale
  declarations.

### Patch Changes

- c217473: Add Playwright smoke tests against production builds of web, admin and api: pages render, health probes answer, and
  the public site sets no cookies and keeps zoom enabled. Read the platform name at request time: the layouts were
  prerendered at build time, so every image would have shipped without a title.
- 8a9f648: Add the Helm charts: a subchart per deployable and the `aiontheballot` umbrella chart (migrations as an Argo CD PreSync Job,
  routes for the public and admin hosts, restrictive security contexts and resource limits).
- e13c986: Move to @slango.configs/typescript 3.0.0 and @slango.configs/vitest 2.1.0: drop the composite/incremental overrides
  and the i18n JSON include they required, and write the Vitest configs in TypeScript.
