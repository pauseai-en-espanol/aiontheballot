# @aiontheballot/og

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f4eabe: Tenants' own logos (migration `tenant_brand_uploads`): a brand selection can name one of the tenant's uploaded
  images, public while an active tenant selects it. The API serves the home data's brand images by hash; the web app
  shows the operator's logo in the coming-soon page's header and footer, at `/brand/{sha256}.{ext}` cached as immutable,
  and draws it on the share cards.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bcb112: Link previews for the coming-soon page: Open Graph and Twitter tags, the canonical address and `hreflang` from the
  routing table, and share images in the four sizes from the new `packages/og` (satori, then resvg, fonts embedded),
  served from content-hash URLs cached as immutable, with 304s. Images are pre-rendered while their page renders and
  when a server starts. The hero's name is sized by the viewport's height too.
